      <h2>Amazing Film</h2>
       <p>There are alot of good Movies but only a few can be considered great.
      <br>Poor attempts at comedy or horror seem to be the only Movies that have come
      <br>out in recent times but still some directors put alot of love into there works.
      <br>Some of my favorite movies would be...
       </p>

         <li>Django unchained <br>
